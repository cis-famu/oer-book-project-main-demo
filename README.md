# Open Educational Resource Project

This is a semester long project where we will be creating a supplemental textbook that we will distribute as an open educational resource (OER).

## What is OER?

OER stands for Open Educational Resources. OER refers to educational materials that are made freely available for anyone to use, share, and modify. These resources are typically released under an open license, such as Creative Commons licenses, which grants users the permission to use the materials without cost and often with the right to modify and distribute them as well.

Examples of OER include:

1. Textbooks: Openly licensed textbooks that can be accessed and used by students and educators without any cost.
2. Lecture notes: Lecture materials, slides, and presentations that are openly shared for others to use and adapt.
3. Videos: Educational videos, lectures, and tutorials that are made freely available on platforms like YouTube or educational websites.
4. Quizzes and assessments: Openly licensed quizzes and assessments that can be used for testing and evaluation purposes.
5. Learning modules: Modular units of educational content that can be combined and customized to fit specific courses or subjects.
6. Interactive simulations: Software-based simulations and virtual laboratories for learning various concepts.
7. Educational games: Games designed for educational purposes, fostering engagement and learning.

The use of OER has gained momentum in recent years as a response to the rising costs of traditional textbooks and educational resources. OER can significantly reduce financial barriers to education, making learning more accessible to students around the world. Additionally, OER promote collaboration and the sharing of knowledge, as educators and learners can modify and improve the materials to suit their needs and preferences.

## Why are we doing this?

Aside from creating resources that you and your fellow students can use, this project will help you to have a deeper understanding of the topics we are learning. By writing your own book chapters, you will allow you engage the knowledge from a different perspective. You will have the chance to customize your learning path to meet your needs. It is also an opportunity to dive into topic you may feel the assigned text does not present well.

## What will we be doing?

At the start of each module, your team will choose an editor. Each member should be editor at least once. I will provide your with the chapter learning objectives, which we will review during the Friday lab session. Your team will have two weeks to write and edit your chapter. Your chapter must address each of the objectives, and will contain topics similar to those your are reading the course textbook. 

You are not to simply quote the textbook or find another textbook to quote. **You will be writing an original text.** I do expect that you will be referencing material from other books, articles, and websites, therefore you will include a list of reference at the end of your chapter in APA format. 

After your chapter has been graded, each editor will meet and create the final version of the book chapter. You will have 1 week to do so.

## What does the editor do?
The role of the editor of an Open Educational Resources (OER) book chapter is essential to ensure the quality, coherence, and effectiveness of the chapter within the larger context of the book. Editors play a critical role in shaping and refining the content contributed by authors. Here are the key responsibilities and contributions of an editor:

1. **Content Review and Quality Control:** The editor reviews the content of the chapter to ensure accuracy, clarity, and consistency. They check for factual errors, proper citations, and adherence to the book's style and guidelines. The editor helps maintain high-quality standards throughout the chapter.

2. **Coherence and Flow:** Editors ensure that the chapter fits seamlessly into the overall structure of the OER book. They review the flow of information, transitions between sections, and the logical organization of content to enhance the reader's understanding and engagement.

3. **Language and Writing Style:** Editors pay attention to the language and writing style used in the chapter. They suggest improvements in grammar, syntax, and readability to enhance the clarity and coherence of the content.

4. **Alignment with Learning Objectives:** The editor ensures that the chapter aligns with the learning objectives of the OER book and the specific goals of the chapter. They help authors fine-tune their content to match the intended educational outcomes.

5. **Accessibility and Inclusivity:** Editors may assess the chapter's accessibility and inclusivity, ensuring that the content is suitable for a diverse audience of learners. They may advise on ways to make the content more inclusive and accommodating to different learning needs.

6. **Feedback and Revision:** Editors provide constructive feedback to authors, suggesting improvements and revisions to strengthen the chapter. They work collaboratively with authors to refine the content and address any concerns.

7. **Copyright and Licensing:** Editors help authors understand the implications of open licensing and ensure that the chapter complies with the chosen open license, allowing for free sharing and modification by others.

8. **Visual and Multimedia Elements:** If the chapter includes visual elements or multimedia, editors may evaluate their relevance, quality, and appropriateness. They work with authors to enhance the visual presentation of the content.

9. **Attribution and Citations:** Editors ensure that proper attribution and citations are given to external sources used in the chapter. This helps maintain academic integrity and acknowledges the work of others.

10. **Final Review and Publication:** Before the chapter is published, the editor conducts a final review to ensure that all revisions and improvements have been implemented. They collaborate with the publishing team to prepare the chapter for distribution as part of the OER book.

In summary, the editor plays a crucial role in shaping the chapter's content, improving its quality, and ensuring it aligns with the overall goals of the OER book. Their work enhances the educational value of the chapter and contributes to the success of the entire OER project.

## Tools

For this activity, we will be using GitHub and [OER Common Open Author](https://oercommons.org/authoring-overview) (you should alredy have accounts for these). There are resources on using both of these tools posted on the resources page of the course. 

For the team version of the chapter, you will be using GitHub. For the combined final version, you will be using Open Author. 

## Team Submission Requirements

Each team must:
1. Create a a new file for each chapter (eg., Chapter-1.md)
2. List the objectives for the chapter
3. Write the following sections:
    - **Introduction**: introduce the topic(s) the chapter cover and how they relate to what you have already learnt
    - **Section per topic**: For each topic that you indentify, write a section in the chapter covering that topic. Include example code, pseudocode, and diagrams (flowcharts, heirarchy chart, etc.) as needed. Also include any other images that you believe explain the topic well. You may include sub-sections within each section (as needed).
    - **Review Questions**: After each section, include at least 3 topic review questions. These can be multiple choice, completion, matching, or true/false questions. Remember to include the answers as well.
    - **Summary**: Summarize the main points covered in the chapter. Use bullet points.
    - **Key Terms**: Include a list important terms and defintions
    - **Programming Exercises**: Write at least 1 programming problem that utilizes the concept covered in the chapter.
    - **References**: Include references in APA format.
    - **Editor**: Indentify which student was the editor the the chapter.

*Note: Each team member should be contributing to the chapter. GitHub will indicate what edits each team member made. Also remember to use open license images and videos only.*
